          <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>It is easy to make the LED blink on an Arduino. We turn it on, wait, turn it off, wait again, and
             then we repeat the cycle.</p>
          <p>The Arduino boards come with an internal LED connected to pin 13. It is simple to
             use and always there. But most times we want our own LEDs in different places of our system.
             We might connect something on top of the Arduino board and can no longer see the internal
             LED. Here, we will explore how to connect an external LED.</p>

          <h4>Getting Ready</h4>
          <p>For this recipe, we need the following ingredients:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>An Arduino board connected to the computer via USB</p></li>
            <li><p>A breadboard and jumper wires</p></li>
            <li><p>A regular LED (the typical LED size is 3 mm)</p></li>
            <li><p>A resistor between 220â€“1,000 ohm</p></li>
          </ul>

          <h4>How To Do It</h4>
          <p>Follow these steps to connect an external LED to an Arduino board:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><p>Mount the resistor on the breadboard. Connect one end of the resistor to a digital
                   pin on the Arduino board using a jumper wire.</p></li>
            <li><p>Mount the LED on the breadboard. Connect the anode (+) pin of the LED to the
                   available pin on the resistor. We can determine the anode on the LED in two ways.
                   Usually, the longer pin is the anode. Another way is to look for the flat edge on the
                   outer casing of the LED. The pin next to the flat edge is the cathode (-).</p></li>
            <li><p>Connect the LED cathode (-) to the Arduino GND using jumper wires.</p></li>
          </ol>

          <h4>The Code</h4>
         <p>The following code will make the external LED blink:</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>// Declare the LED pin
int LED = 2;
void setup() {
// Declare the pin for the LED as Output
  pinMode(LED, OUTPUT);
}
void loop(){
// Here we will turn the LED ON and wait 200 milliseconds
  digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
  delay(200);
// Here we will turn the LED OFF and wait 200 milliseconds
  digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
  delay(200);
}</code></pre>
          <p><b>HELPFUL NOTE :</b> If the LED is connected to a different pin, simply change the LED value to
           the value of the pin that has been used.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Code Breakdown</h4>
          <p>The code simply turns the LED on, waits, and then turns it off again. Compared to the
previous recipe, in this one we will use a blocking approach by using the <code>delay()</code> function.
Here we declare the LED pin on digital pin 2:</p>
          <code class="code-block" style="margin: auto; display: block;">int LED = 2;</code>
          <p>In the <code>setup()</code> function we set the LED pin as an output:</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>void setup() {
  pinMode(LED, OUTPUT);
}</code></pre>
          <p>In the <code>loop()</code> function, we continuously turn the LED on, wait 200 milliseconds, and then
             we turn it off. After turning it off we need to wait another 200 milliseconds, otherwise it will
             instantaneously turn on again and we will only see a permanently on LED.</p>
<pre class="code-block"><code>void loop(){
  // Here we will turn the LED ON and wait 200 miliseconds
  digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
  delay(200);
  // Here we will turn the LED OFF and wait 200 miliseconds
  digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
  delay(200);
}</code></pre>

          <h4>How It Works</h4>
          <p>This is all semiconductor magic. When the second digital pin is set to HIGH , the Arduino
             provides 5 V of electricity, which travels through the resistor to the LED and GND. When
             enough voltage and current is present, the LED will light up. The resistor limits the amount
             of current passing through the LED. Without it, it is possible that the LED (or worse, the
             Arduino pin) will burn. Try to avoid using LEDs without resistors; this can easily destroy the
             LED or even your Arduino.</p>
